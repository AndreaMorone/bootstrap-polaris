# Bootstrap Polaris

A [Shopify Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/) themed version of [Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta-2](http://getbootstrap.com/). View demo here [https://derekmorash.github.io/bootstrap-polaris/demo/index.html](https://derekmorash.github.io/bootstrap-polaris/demo/index.html).

Shopify Polaris is a great way to make apps for Shopify that provide a consitent feel to the whole ecosystem, however it is heavily geared towards React and doesn't have very clean or semantic markup. Bootstrap Polaris is meant to keep that consisent UX while using light semantic and accessible markup, while removing the need for a front end JS framework.

## Development Instalation

- Clone Repo and run `npm install`
- Run `gulp`
- Edit files in `scss/`
- Gulp compiles changes into the `dist` and `demo` directories. Both versions are minified but the demo version has sourcemaps enabled.
